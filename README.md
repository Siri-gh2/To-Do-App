o-Do List App – A Simple and Intuitive Task Manager
The To-Do List App is a clean, user-friendly, and fully functional task management tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to help users organize their daily life with ease — whether it's for work, study, personal goals, or simple reminders. With real-time updates and persistent data storage using the browser's localStorage, this app ensures users don’t lose track of their tasks even after refreshing or closing the browser.

This project is ideal for beginners in frontend web development and a great addition to any developer’s portfolio. It demonstrates practical skills in DOM manipulation, user interaction handling, and data persistence without requiring any frameworks or external libraries.

🌟 Key Features
➕ Add Tasks
Users can easily add tasks by typing in the input box and clicking the "Add" button or pressing enter. The app prevents empty entries to ensure task quality.

✅ Mark as Completed
Tasks can be marked as done by simply clicking on them. Completed tasks are styled differently to provide a clear visual distinction.

🗑️ Delete Tasks
Each task has a delete icon that allows users to remove tasks they no longer need.

🔁 Real-Time Filtering
The app provides three filtering options:

All: Displays every task

Active: Shows tasks that are yet to be completed

Completed: Shows only finished tasks

Users can switch between these views effortlessly.

🧹 Clear Completed Tasks
With a single click, users can remove all completed tasks, helping keep the list neat and focused on pending items.

🔢 Task Counter
A dynamic task counter updates in real-time, showing how many tasks are active out of the total list.

🌙 Dark Mode
The app includes a light/dark mode toggle to enhance user comfort and accessibility. The preferred theme is saved and applied automatically on the next visit.

💾 Persistent Storage with LocalStorage
All tasks and theme settings are stored locally in the browser using localStorage. This means users can leave the page or close their browser and come back to find their tasks exactly as they left them.

📱 Responsive Design
The layout is fully responsive and optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
